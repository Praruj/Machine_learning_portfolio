# Machine Learning Portfolio 📊

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey! 🚀  
This repository is my personal portfolio where I implement and practice various machine learning algorithms as I progress through my studies.

I start from the basics and gradually move to more advanced topics. New folders, notebooks, and implementations will be added regularly as I learn and practice daily.

The goal is to deepen my understanding, experiment with concepts, and showcase clean, well-documented code.

## 📌 Current Progress
- Just getting started!
- Implemented:
  - **Linear Regression** (Simple & Multiple)

## 🚀 Planned Additions

As my studies continue, I plan to add:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Neural Networks (from scratch + TensorFlow / PyTorch)
- Ensemble Methods
- Deep Learning
- NLP & Computer Vision

## ⚙️ Setup (Recommended)

This project uses a virtual environment for clean dependency management.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praruj/Machine_learning_portfolio.git
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2️⃣ Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
